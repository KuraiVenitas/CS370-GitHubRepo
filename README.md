For this project, I was tasked with dtrianing an agent to complete a maze game through the use of Q-learning techniques. Part of this process was implementing espilon-greedy logic to taper the exploration and exploitation behavior of the agen tto reach the goal, which was a bottom right tile within the maze. As cycles were completed, the agent was able to sucessfully complete the maze with a very high success rate within approximately 20 minutes. The section of code I was responsible for was the core functionality of qtrain function.

Tying into this project's overall lesson, computer scientists find ways to solve complex computational problems, and typically use code to design a solution for them. When approaching a problem as a computer scientist a few things must be understood about the problem, like the desired goal and the boundaries the program/solution needs to work within aka the scope. Knowing these two things is crucial to outline a path forward to reach milestones needed to complete a project and achieve the desired outcome. Needs requested of the developer must be met for the end user and the organization while being honest, trustworthy, contributing to the well-being of society and not cause harm.
